<p><strong>Update</strong>: The nice guys from travis-ci <a
    href="http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2013-06-17-time-for-a-vm-update/">have added an API token for GitHub</a>.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to host my open-source projects. Most of them are PHP libraries.</p>
<p>For testing those libraries, I use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. Every commit I push to the GitHub
  repository gets tested by their CI (Continuous Integration) server.</p>
<p>Of course, I use <a href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> for managing dependencies on my PHP projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/vierbergenlars/defer/jobs/7817209"><img class=" wp-image-15 alignright"

  Usually everything works out fine, but sometimes the dependency installation fails because I reached the GitHub API
  limit. That's <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">60 calls</a> per hour per IP address for
  unauthenticated requests. Since Travis runs <em>a lot</em> of tests for various projects, it is possible that
  an&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;project already exhausted the API limit.</p>
<p>Because composer keeps waiting for input of a username and password, Travis aborts the build after 10 minutes, and it
  shows up as errored.</p>

<h1>The bad solution</h1>
<p>I have seen <a
    href="http://blog.simplytestable.com/creating-and-using-a-github-oauth-token-with-travis-and-composer/">other</a> <a
    href="http://drafts.easybib.com/post/38230669404/composer-github-travisci">blogs</a> suggesting to create an OAuth
  token, and just include it in your repository.&nbsp;<strong>That is a very bad idea!</strong>&nbsp;The token grants
  unlimited access to your account via the GitHub API. If someone else got a hold of it, they can do all kinds of bad
  stuff to your account.</p>
<h1>The good solution</h1>
<p>Travis supports encrypted environment variables. That is great news, as we can encrypt or OAuth token and put it in
  an environment variable, right? Now the only thing Composer needs to do is read the env variable and use that token to
  authenticate to the API.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Composer does look for an OAuth environment variable.</p>
<h1>The ugly solution</h1>
<p>Luckily, Composer does read&nbsp;<em>~/.composer/config.json</em>, and merges it with the
  package's&nbsp;<em>composer.json</em>. So, it's just a matter of getting the environment variable in the configuration
  file.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Encrypt the environment variable</h2>
<p>Travis provides a gem that helps you to set up secure environment variables. Go ahead and install it.<br />
  <em>Note: You'll need ruby and rubygems to install the travis gem.</em></p>
<p>[code language="bash"]gem install travis[/code]</p>
<p>Next, we need an OAuth token to reach the GitHub API. Go to the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://github.com/settings/applications"><em>Applications</em></a> section of your account settings, and add
  a personal API token.</p>
<p>It is time to encrypt the token. Navigate to the project directory, and encrypt the environment variable.</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]travis encrypt GH_OAUTH=4584c14558afe5580abec2d57c2256e6cb804cbf --add env.global[/code]</p>
<p>The encrypted variable gets added to the project's&nbsp;<em>.travis.yml</em> automatically.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Write a script to generate <em>~/.composer/config.json</em></h2>
<p>We still need a script to create the configuration file. It is a very basic script.</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]if [ &quot;$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ];<br />
  then<br />
  mkdir ~/.composer/<br />
  echo '{ &quot;config&quot;: {&quot;github-oauth&quot;:{&quot;github.com&quot;: ' &gt; ~/.composer/config.json<br />
  echo &quot;\&quot;$GH_OAUTH\&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.composer/config.json<br />
  echo '}}}' &gt;&gt; ~/.composer/config.json<br />
  fi[/code]</p>
<p>First, it checks whether Travis has secure env variables enabled. For security purposes, they get disabled when
  testing a pull request.</p>
<p>Then, create the <em>~/.composer</em> directory and write the configuration to the configuration file.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Add setup script to <em>.travis.yml</em></h2>
<p>Finally, the script has to be run before any Composer command is executed. Add the setup script
  in&nbsp;<em>.travis.yml</em>. You may also need to <em>chmod +x</em>&nbsp;the script before it will execute.<br />
  To disable all interactive questions Composer may ask, add <code>COMPOSER_NO_INTERACTION=1</code> to your environment
  variables.</p>
<h2>That's it</h2>
<p>You may want to do this for every project using Composer and Travis. It is important to run&nbsp;<em>travis
    encrypt</em> separately for each project, as the encryption key is different for each project.</p>
<p>If you rather learn by example, you may want to look at <a
